[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

> Welcome to the dumbest take on Dungeons & Dragons.

DnDumb is a custom D&D manual project filled with questionable decisions, absurd ideas, and homebrew content you never knew you needed. Whether you're looking for serious content with a twist or something completely unhinged for your next session, you've come to the right place.

This repository powers [DnDumb](https://your-site-url.com), a documentation site built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), and contains:

- 🧪 **Homebrew content**: original spells, items, classes, and races
- 🔞 **NSFW Homebrew**: stuff that might get you kicked out of a family-friendly table
- 🎲 **Campaign-Specific Content**: modules and artifacts used in our ongoing campaign (spoilers ahead!)
- 📚 **Guides & References**: resources to help you make D&D... dumber

## 🧙 FAQ

### ❓ I want to create a `<thing>`, how do I do it?

Let’s say you want to create an `item` in the `homebrew` section.

1. Go to `src/content/docs/homebrew/items/`
2. Add a new `.md` file by copying the format of an existing one
3. Write your nonsense

### 🙀 But my `<thing>` doesn’t exist!!!1!

1. Create a new folder under `homebrew` (e.g., `spells`, `cursed-races`, etc.)
2. Open `astro.config.mjs` in the root of the project
3. Add your new folder to the `sidebar` config so it appears in the site navigation
