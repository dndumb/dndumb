_A handy sack that hides a portal to the Plane of Overkill, where you can conveniently store all the excess damage you deal to your enemies._

Whenever you or your allies deal more damage to a creature than it is necessary to kill it, that damage is magically transferred into the sack and kept safe on the Plane of Overkill (the DM can choose to keep track of this damage or communicate it to the player to keep track of on their sheet).

As an action, you can empty the sack into the face\* of a creature you can see within 60 feet.

> \*It doesn't have to be the face; it can also be anything else, like the stomach, back, knee, or the toe you're always stubbing against the nightstand.

The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, with a DC equal to 10 + the number of damage stored in the sack divided by 10, rounded up. On a failed save, the creature takes force damage equal to the total damage stored in the bag. On a successful save, the creature takes only half that amount of damage.

> Example: If the bag contains 42 points of damage, the DC is 15.

Once used, roll a D20. If the result is 20, the bag returns to its original shape, empty and ready to refill with new damage. Otherwise, it dissolves into the Overkill Plane, leaving behind a faint stench of sweaty armpits and the sound of a bodybuilder screaming as he lifts a barbell and then drops it noisily onto the gym floor.
