These potions, sold in the most bizarre stalls of the Wizarding Market, are an irresistible invitation to risk and adventure. Offered at a discounted price of just 1 gold coin each, they seem to scream "Try your luck!" to anyone who sets eyes on them.

Each bottle is unique: irregularly shaped glass and sparkling colors, caps sealed with sealing wax, and no labels. Yes, no labels. No indication, no clue, just an aura of mystery that almost seems to challenge you to discover what they contain.

There is no spell or magic trick that can reveal their secret. The only way to know what they do? Drink them. Maybe it will be the start of a great adventure, or maybe a moment of pure fun... or embarrassment. But then again, who can resist a deal like this?

### Amethyst Potion
*Potion of the Flexible Body*
#### Description
A strange amethyst-colored potion with a faint mint aroma. When shaken, golden sparks dance inside.
#### Effect
For 1 hour, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and the ability to compress your body to squeeze through narrow spaces (up to 6 inches wide). You also gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.

### Emerald Potion
*Potion of Rapid Regeneration*
#### Description
An emerald green liquid that seems to pulse as if it has a life of its own. When opened, it emits the scent of freshly cut grass.
#### Effect
After drinking this potion, for the next 10 minutes you regain 1d4 hit points at the start of each of your turns. If your hit point maximum is already full, you gain no additional hit points, but you have a faint greenish glow that makes you appear “healthy.”

### Pink Potion
*Potion of the Harmonious Voice*
#### Description
A bright pink fluid that glows when exposed to light. Emitting a strong candy scent, it creates a light trail of bubbles whenever it is shaken.
#### Effect
After drinking this potion, your voice becomes incredibly melodious and musical for 1 hour. You have advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks related to singing. However, every word you utter is sung exaggeratedly, making normal communication difficult.

### Clear Potion
*Potion of the Hot Air Balloon*
#### Description
A clear potion that appears almost empty, but emits a faint hissing sound when opened. When looked at closely, microscopic air bubbles swirl within it.
#### Effect
After drinking this potion, your body fills with light air for 10 minutes. During this time, you are unable to carry any significant weight and float 5 feet above the ground. Gravity pulls you normally, but you cannot land until the effect ends (even pushing yourself off the ground requires an action).
