*At first glance, it looks like a normal healing potion. Then you notice that the liquid is almost transparent, as if the magic had decided to take a break. Tiny seeds dance lazily inside, replacing the classic golden glow with a grassy, confused shimmer.*

##### The more diluted it is, the better it works... or so they say.

### Effect

This potion heals based on **how unintelligent you are**... This is not a joke. Or maybe it is... Either way, the result is the same.

- If your **Intelligence** modifier is **0 or higher**, *it does absolutely nothing.*  
  In fact, you might even feel a little cheated.
- If you have a **negative Intelligence** modifier, the potion rewards you for your simplicity:  
  it heals **1d4 hit points for each negative point**.  
  *(Example: INT mod -3 → heals 3d4 HP.)*

<NoteBox>
It is important to note that no one has ever understood how it works. Alchemists claim that the formula reacts with “the cognitive humility of the soul,” while clerics speak of “miracles inversely proportional to IQ.”  
Wizards, for their part, simply shake their heads in disapproval and order a beer.
</NoteBox>

### Description

The potion looks like an extremely diluted version of a classic healing potion: the liquid is almost transparent, with only a faint pinkish reflection when held up to the light.
Instead of the classic golden sparkle, tiny suspended seeds, apparently vegetable, float inside, moving lazily as if trying to remember why they exist.
Those who observe it for a long time swear they can see the seeds forming shapes resembling hemp leaves, but no one has ever been able to prove it... or remember it the next day.

### Recipe

#### Known ingredients (more or less):
- **50 ml of raspberry juice** to give it that magical pale pink color
- **A teaspoon of raw honey**, preferably collected by bees that have known pain
- **A few elven hemp seeds** or normal hemp seeds, if you live in a region with few elves
- **A drop of apple cider vinegar**, because “it helps with inner purification” according to the original elf
- **A breath of air** bottled on a particularly optimistic day
- **5 liters of rainwater**, some say that the more water there is, the better it works

<DescriptiveBox>
“The secret is dilution. And faith. But above all, dilution.”
</DescriptiveBox>

#### Preparation:
Stir counterclockwise until you forget where you started.
Leave to rest overnight in the moonlight... or candlelight, if it rains.
Filter with a used handkerchief “but not too used.”

### Famous Anecdotes

- **The Half-Blind Elf who created the potion:** She swears she found the formula “in a dream,” although she later admitted that it may have been a nightmare or a flashback from aromatic herbs.
- **The Skeptical Bard:** drank the potion to prove it didn't work. He woke up two days later perfectly healed... but with his INT reduced to 7.
- **The Druid of the Smoky Forest:** claims that the seeds inside “sing if you listen to them with your heart.” No one has ever dared to verify this.
- **The Common Sense Society:** declared the potion “scientifically impossible” and was then disbanded for lack of a sense of humor.

### Use and Precautions

Do not shake before use: it serves no purpose, but you may convince yourself that it works better.  
Do not mix with real healing potions—they may cancel each other out in a reaction of **quantum skepticism**.

Anyone attempting to produce it must pass an **Alchemy DC 15** check, but only if they are willing to admit they don't know what they are doing. Otherwise, they automatically fail.

### DM Notes

- A character can **recognize the suspicious herbal origin** with a **Nature DC 10** or **Arcane DC 15** check.
- If the potion is **magically analyzed**, it reveals a faint aura of *“concentrated illusion and despair”*.
- Characters with an INT below 8 heal normally and gain advantage on their next saving throw against depression (roleplaying).
- Characters with an INT above 10 who drink it must make a **Wisdom DC 12 saving throw** to avoid laughing or cursing.
- If someone attempts to **recreate the recipe**, the DM can roll 1d6:
- 1-2 → tap water,
- 3-4 → slightly warm tea,
- 5 → relaxing infusion,
- 6 → miraculously works.
