The Banshee’s Kiss is served in elegant black-crystal glasses and smells faintly of burnt lilac. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, but every bard in the realm swears it was first distilled by a banshee who got tired of screaming and wanted to drink instead.

##### Popular toast when drinking:
*"May your liver fail before your courage does!"*

Despite being considered a luxury spirit, it is commonly banned in temples, hospitals, and most wizard colleges (due to "historical incidents").

### Random Effects Table
<CensoredText>
| d20 | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | The drinker sneezes with such force that all creatures within 30 feet are startled. For the next round, everyone in range has disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check. Gesundheit! |
| 2 | The shadow of a random creature becomes sentient and sassy for the next 24 hours. It mimics actions, flips off guards, and occasionally narrates out loud. |
| 3 | You are affected by the [**Levitate**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#levitate_phb) spell (DC 15) for 1 minute. No, you don't get control. Yes, your friends will laugh. |
| 4 | A mysterious scar appears on your body. It might tell a story... or just look cool. Removable only with [**Greater Restoration**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#greater%20restoration_phb) or [**Wish**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#wish_phb). |
| 5 | You blink out of existence! You're under the effects of [**Blink**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#blink_phb) for 1 minute. Good luck staying in the fight. |
| 6 | [**Mirror Image**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#mirror%20image_phb) activates. Your illusory duplicates have their own opinions about your fashion sense. |
| 7 | The skin of a random creature turns silver and reflective for 24 hours. They gain advantage on saving throws against spells; spell attacks against them have disadvantage. Fancy! |
| 8 | Cast [**Detect Thoughts**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb) on a random party member. That awkward silence? It just got louder. |
| 9 | You suffer intense headaches and nosebleeds. Disadvantage on Perception checks for 1d4+1 hours. Ow. |
| 10 | You are enclosed in [**Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#otiluke's%20resilient%20sphere_phb) for 1 minute. Consider this a timeout. |
| 11 | You learn a random wizard spell for 24 hours. You can't unlearn it. Hope it's useful. |
| 12 | You may cast [**Wish**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#wish_phb) once in the next minute. No pressure. Reroll if you’ve already done this in the past 24 hours. |
| 13 | You grow golden feathers. Gain +1 AC for 24 hours. People will compliment your plumage. |
| 14 | You are overcome with the urge to sing. Every sentence you say for 24 hours becomes a musical performance. Gain advantage on Charisma checks. Lose dignity. |
| 15 | You grow the tail of your favorite animal. It is *very* expressive and lasts 24 hours. The tail is not under your control and may embarrass you. |
| 16 | You gain the effects of [**Telepathy**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#telepathy_phb) for 24 hours. Great for gossip. |
| 17 | You immediately cast [**Time Stop**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#time%20stop_phb). No components needed. Constitution is your casting stat. Your DM starts sweating. |
| 18 | You are randomly affected by **enlarge** or **reduce** for 1d4 minutes. Flip a coin. Hope for the best. |
| 19 | Your skin changes color permanently (unless magically removed). Roll a d4: 1. Purple w/ yellow splotches; 2. Orange tiger stripes; 3. Tree-frog green; 4. Hot pink w/ yellow dots. You're fabulous. |
| 20 | You can only cluck like a chicken for 1 hour. But you can talk to chickens. They’ve been waiting. [**Remove Curse**](https://5e.tools/spells.html#remove%20curse_phb) ends this early. |
