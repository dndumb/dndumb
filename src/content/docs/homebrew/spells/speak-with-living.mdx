**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** S, M *(a sip of any alcoholic beverage)* \
**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Description
You touch a willing creature that speaks at least one language, granting it the charm and social confidence of an extrovert.

For the duration, the target becomes more outgoing, articulate, and sociable, experiencing a heightened sense of ease and enjoyment in social interactions.

- The target’s **Charisma score cannot be less than 16**.
- If the target’s Charisma is **17 or greater**, they gain **advantage** on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks.

Additionally, the target:
- Feels more comfortable in social settings.
- Can effortlessly initiate conversations and engage with others.
- Gains a heightened sense of humor and wit, making them more entertaining and likable.

The spell doesn’t alter the target’s fundamental personality or values but temporarily amplifies their extroverted traits.

Once the spell ends, the target reverts to their normal demeanor and may remember the experience with clarity.

<NoteBox>
This enchantment is popular in bardic colleges, social galas, and awkward family dinners. The required material component — a sip of alcohol — also explains why it’s banned in most monasteries.

### Fun Fact
**The spell was originally called "Liquid Courage."** But the Bardic Guild renamed it for marketing reasons after too many college initiations got out of hand.

**Helpful for Job Interviews:** Several adventurers have credited this spell for helping them “absolutely nail” negotiations with kings, dragons, and angry innkeepers.

**Creative Applications:** Use before public performances, political debates, or family interventions. Works particularly well in taverns — just don’t mix it with *Zone of Truth*.
