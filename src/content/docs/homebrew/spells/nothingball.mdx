### Description
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of `nothing`.

Each creature in a 30-foot radius (9 meters) must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is bewildered by the complete lack of effect from a 4th-level spell and becomes affected as if under the *Confusion* spell.

An affected creature can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior.

| d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:----:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1   | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |
| 2–6  | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
| 7–8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If no creature is within reach, it does nothing this turn.                        |
| 9–10 | The creature acts and moves normally.                                                                                                                                                           |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

<NoteBox>
This spell is infamous in prankster circles, especially among bards who like to shout "KABOOM!" dramatically while casting it, just to watch the enemies panic... and then stand around in existential confusion.

### Fun Fact
**The spell does literally nothing.** That’s the point. It’s a psychological bomb — the arcane equivalent of telling someone "your shoes are untied" just to mess with them.

**Nothing to See Here:** Some arcane scholars believe the spell is a metaphysical critique of the overuse of destructive evocation spells. Others just think it’s hilarious.

**Creative Applications:** Trick a rival wizard into counterspelling it, waste a legendary resistance, or cause absolute havoc in a tightly packed group of goblins with performance anxiety.
