**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Contact \
**Components:** V, S, M *(a jar of salt or a jar of oil, which is consumed if you don't use an arcane catalyst)* \
**Duration**: 1 month *(or more; see below)* 

### Description
With a gentle touch and a few culinary-flavored magic words, you infuse a preservative aura into an edible item no larger than a 3-foot cube. This item will not suffer spoilage, mold, decay, or loss of flavor for 1 month. \
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell lasts for 1 month for each slot level above 1st.

<NoteBox>
The spell is known to preserve it tastefully, as foods treated in this way retain their freshness but acquire a subtle flavor based on 
the material used:
- **Sell:** Adds a savory, slightly salty touch. Perfect for meats and fish.
- **Oil:** Gives a velvety aftertaste, great for vegetables and bread.

### Fun Fact
**Arcane chefs love this trick!** It's a well-kept secret in starred restaurants in larger cities.

**A Problematic Recipe:** Some gluttonous wizards have used it to preserve cakes, but when the shelf life expired, the cakes instantly "aged" in seconds, turning into explosive dust or mold!

**Creative Applications:** The spell has been used to save food supplies during long sieges, but also to preserve rare flowers for especially busy lovers.
