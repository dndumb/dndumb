**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S *(un solenne "dove cavolo è il mogano?")* \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

### Description
This incredibly specific spell allows the caster to **magically detect the presence of genuine mahogany wood** within a 30-foot radius. If there is any mahogany in the area—furniture, decor, suspiciously fancy toothpicks—it will softly glow in the caster’s vision.

If there is no mahogany present, the spell ends with a subtle but deeply unsatisfying “woodless ping.”

**Wild Misfires (Roll a 1):** If the caster rolls a natural 1 on any relevant Intelligence (Arcana) check during use, they are cursed with “Mahogany Myopia” for the duration. \
This causes them to **mistake random objects for mahogany**, including but not limited to:
- Dogs
- Rocks
- The air
- Their own hands

<NoteBox>
Originally created by a druid-carpenter with *very* specific interior decorating needs.\
Many scholars believe this spell is a protest against cheap pine furniture.

### Fun Fact
**Banned in several woodworking guilds**, especially after an apprentice tried to cast it in an IKEA and collapsed from overstimulation.

**Creative Applications:** 
- Impress wealthy nobles by complimenting all their “real mahogany” furnishings (even if it’s clearly fake).
- Win debates about what counts as "vintage."
- Waste a perfectly good spell slot.

**Cautionary Tale:** One wizard claimed to have found a mahogany elemental in the forest. Turns out it was just a normal tree and he was very, very lost.
