**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M *(a piece of wood and a solemn "it's mahogany?!")*  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

### Description

This spell allows the caster to **sense and visually detect the presence of genuine mahogany wood** within a 30-foot radius.  
If any object or creature within range contains even the faintest trace of mahogany, it emits a soft magical glow, and the caster **learns the age of the tree** it was sourced from.

> *Yes, even that suspiciously ornate spoon.*  
> *No, not living trees. That would be arborism.*

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by:
- 1 foot of stone  
- 1 inch of common metal  
- A thin sheet of lead  
- 3 feet of wood or dirt *(ironically, including non-mahogany wood)*

It cannot differentiate between raw and worked wood, making it equally useful for identifying priceless antiques or very cursed furniture.

### Wild Misfires (Natural 1 on Arcana)

You are cursed with **Mahogany Myopia** for the duration.  
You may start to **hallucinate mahogany everywhere**, including:
- Dogs  
- Rocks  
- Air currents  
- Your own magnificent wizard hands

<NoteBox>
First developed by a mahogany-obsessed druid-carpenter with radical views on pine.  
Now widely used (and occasionally abused) by interior decorators, antique hunters, and deranged wizards.

### Creative Applications
- Convince nobles that their fake furniture is real. (Bonus: They *will* start to doubt their ancestors.)
- Win petty arguments in antique stores.
- Get banned from IKEA. Again.

### Cautionary Tale
One wizard swore he found a mahogany elemental.  
Turns out it was just a benchâ€”and he was just very, very dehydrated.
