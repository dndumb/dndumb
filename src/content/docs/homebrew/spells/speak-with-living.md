You touch a willing creature that speaks at least one language, granting it the charm and social confidence of an extrovert.

For the duration, the target becomes more outgoing, articulate, and sociable, experiencing a heightened sense of ease and enjoyment in social interactions.

- The target's **Charisma score cannot be less than 16**.
- If the target's Charisma is **17 or greater**, they gain **advantage** on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks.

Additionally, the target:
- Feels more comfortable in social settings.
- Can effortlessly initiate conversations and engage with others.
- Gains a heightened sense of humor and wit, making them more entertaining and likable.

This spell does not alter the target's fundamental personality or values but temporarily amplifies their extroverted traits.

Once the spell ends, the target reverts to their normal demeanor and may remember the experience with clarity.
