title: Detect Mohogany
---

*1rd-level enchantment*

---

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (any piece of wood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, 10 minutes

---

For the duration, you sense the presence of mohogany wood within 30 feet of you. If you sense mohogany wood in this way,
you can use
your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears mohogany wood, and you
learn the age of the tree from which
the wood was taken.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. The spell does not differentiate between worked and unworked wood, and cannot detect
living trees.
