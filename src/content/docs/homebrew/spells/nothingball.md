A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of `nothing`.

Each creature in a 9 meters range (30 feet) must make a Wisdom saving throw, on a failure the creature is confused by the fact that a 4th level spell did nothing 
and is affected by the same effect of a Confusion spell.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

| d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  1   | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2-6  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
| 7-8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.                                                                                                                                                         |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
