---

Welcome, adventurers and chaos-makers! Here at **DnDumb**, we embrace the weird, the wacky, and the downright ridiculous side of tabletop gaming. All the content you'll find here is **homebrew**—completely unofficial and made purely for fun.

Whether you're here to add some humor to your campaign, explore wild new spells, or just enjoy the dumbest ideas ever put into D&D form, remember: nothing here is meant to be taken *too* seriously. So roll a d20, kick back, and enjoy the ride—because DnDumb is all about having a good laugh with your party!

*(P.S. Please don’t bring these to a “rules lawyer” table. Trust us on this one.)*
