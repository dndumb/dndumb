*Wonderful object, common (but very, very frustrating)*

*“Luck is blind. Misfortune has 20/20 vision — and a great sense of humor.”*

### Description
A seemingly ordinary copper coin engraved with a grinning skull on one side and a bearded face on the other.  
If you stare at it for too long, the faces seem to switch places — or maybe it's just your nerves (or the coin laughing at you).

### Properties

**The Curse of Opposite Luck:** Whenever you flip this coin to make a decision, it will *always* land on the opposite of what you wish for.  
- If you want heads — you get tails.  
- If you want tails — you get heads.  
- If you genuinely don't care... the coin lands perfectly **on its edge**, wobbling mockingly for 1d4 rounds before collapsing in whatever direction hurts your pride the most.

**Coinfusion:** When putting the Unlucky Coin away, make a **DC 10 Wisdom saving throw**.  
If you fail, you accidentally slip it into your regular coin pouch.  
When that happens, the coin vanishes, leaving behind **1 gold piece** and an overwhelming sense of regret.

**Snickering Fate (optional DM rule):** Once per day, when the wearer fails a roll by 1 or less, the coin emits a faint giggle that only they can hear. No mechanical effect — but it's really, really annoying.

### Lore & Fun Facts:
- Said to be forged by a minor god of chaos who *still lost* a bet.  
- Collectors claim a “Lucky Coin” also exists — but anyone who finds it becomes too happy to tell others.  
- Flipping two Unlucky Coins at once might cancel their effects... or open a portal to the Plane of Irony.  
- Ideal for players who think “I can’t roll worse than this,” and need to be proven wrong.

### Suggested creative uses
- Great way to decide who will NOT guard the camp.
- Perfect for upsetting a bard who thinks he's lucky.
- Excellent tool for DMs who want to introduce the philosophy of absurdity into a serious campaign.
