*Magical item, rare*

The Wireless Rope is composed of two 12-inch pieces of rope, each about 0.4 inches in diameter. The material is a tangle of shiny black fibers that reflect light in an almost metallic way, yet are incredibly soft and flexible to the touch.

The two pieces are finished with hand-crafted golden ends, known as "endcaps," decorated with small, engraved geometric patterns that appear to glow with a soft light, as if magic itself were passing through them. These endcaps cannot be removed, and always appear perfectly clean, no matter what conditions they are used in.

The magic that binds the two pieces is invisible and intangible. When the ropes are separated beyond 16 feet, they act as if they are joined by a mysterious bond: the two ends cannot be separated beyond this distance, but there is nothing to see or touch. If anyone attempts to pass them, an imperceptible force calls them back to the limiting distance.

##### Dungeon Master
The invisible force that holds these ropes together is the same force that holds adventuring parties together: fragile, frustrating, but inexplicably functional.

### Features
- **Magical Attraction:** If the segments are separated by more than 5 meters, an invisible force slowly pulls them back to the maximum limit, like a magical rubber band. You cannot resist or nullify this force.
- **Eternal Resistance:** The ropes' material is completely immune to physical or magical damage. Cutting or breaking either end is impossible, making them perfect for critical situations.
- **Physical Independence:** The ropes can be moved and used freely within 5 meters without any resistance, but separating them beyond the limit causes the invisible bond to pull them back to the middle point.

### Origins
Many legends surround the origin of the Wireless Cord, but the most popular (and probably the most absurd) tells of a wizard named Althar “the Binder,” an eccentric spellcaster known less for his mastery than for his incredible clumsiness.

Althar was obsessed with the idea of ​​creating an artifact that could magically bind anything without the need for complicated knots. “Knots are for sailors, not archmages!” he often repeated in the heated tones of someone who has just gotten tangled in his own cloak.

One day, in a particularly ambitious (and equally ill-calculated) experiment, Althar tried to enchant a cord to make it self-sufficient: he wanted it to bind itself, stretch as much as he wanted, and, of course, never break. Unfortunately, something went wrong.

Instead of a perfect magical cord, he got two segments separated by an invisible and unstoppable bond. No matter how hard he tried to separate them, the two pieces always came back together, limited to a distance of 5 meters. Frustrated but fascinated by the result, he decided to declare his experiment a success and sold the rope to the first adventurer who asked for it.

A popular tale tells that Althar tested his invention by tying a giant stone golem to a pole. Despite its superhuman strength, the golem could never free itself, as every time it tried to escape, the invisible rope would snap it back.

The problem arose when the wizard, distracted by a discussion about the best nautical knot, forgot that the pole was too close to a slippery slope. The result? A tangled golem, a rolling wizard, and a rope that has since passed from hand to hand, becoming more legendary and more confusing.

### Curiosity
- It is said that by tying two metal cans together at the end you can communicate **screaming** inside them, obviously provided that there are no walls between the two ends of the rope.
- According to some rumors, one day someone managed to tie a knot on the magic that holds the two ends of the rope together and it seems that it is still there but no one knows where.
