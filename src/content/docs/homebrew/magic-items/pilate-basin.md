title: Pontius Pilate's Basin
---

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement)*

---

**Pontius Pilate's Basin** is a small cup that the owner can use to wash their hands.

Using an action, you can place the Basin on a flat surface, put your fingers inside the Basin and mimic the act of washing your hands. 

The Basin will magically fill with water that can't be removed from it (neither by drinking, spilling, siphoning, or whatever means your perverse minds can come up with).

When you remove your hands from the water and dry them, you can declare a responsibility that you do not want to assume.

When you do, the water will disappear from the Basin, and nobody in any plane of existence will ever be able to give you responsibility for that thing for as long as you are attuned to the Basin.

### Properties

Whenever you use the Basin, roll a D6. 

On a 1, the Basin pulverizes and all its effects immediately end.

### Examples

- Every thursday, it's your turn to clean the party's toilet. You can use the Basin to decline this stinky job, and the rest of the party will adjust their turns to compensate for your absence, and never find anything weird with it.

- Oops, you have just "accidentally" killed a guard, and his fellow soldiers have seen you. Just a few seconds before the arrest, you can use the Basin, and you will walk away as an innocent man, while the guards begin interrogating everyone else to solve the "mysterious" murder.
