title: Pontius Pilate's Basin
---

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement)*

---

**Pontius Pilate's Basin** is a small, magical cup that allows its owner to symbolically wash their hands of responsibility.

---

### Usage

As an action, you can place the Basin on a flat surface, put your fingers inside it, and mimic the act of washing your hands. The Basin will magically fill with water that **cannot be removed**—it cannot be drunk, spilled, siphoned, or extracted by any means, regardless of your players' ingenuity.

Once you remove your hands from the water and dry them, you can declare a **responsibility** that you do not want to assume. When you do this, the water vanishes, and no creature on any plane of existence can impose that responsibility upon you for as long as you remain attuned to the Basin.

### Properties

Each time you use the Basin, roll a **d6**.  
- On a result of **1**, the Basin shatters into dust, and all its effects end immediately.

### Examples of Use

- **Avoiding Duties**: Every Thursday, it’s your turn to clean the party’s toilet. Use the Basin to decline this stinky task. The rest of the party will adjust their cleaning schedule to compensate for your absence without questioning or finding anything unusual.  

- **Escaping Consequences**: You’ve just “accidentally” killed a guard, and his fellow soldiers witnessed the act. A few seconds before your arrest, you can use the Basin. The guards will no longer suspect you and will instead interrogate everyone else, attempting to solve the “mysterious” murder.
