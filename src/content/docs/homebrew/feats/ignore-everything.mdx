### Benefits

You have developed a supernatural ability that allows you to ignore everything, including:
- party chat,
- the cleric's desperate cry,
- and your own demise.

Once per **long rest**, when your **hit points are 0**, you can activate this feat to refuse to succumb to unconsciousness. **Literally.**

- **"Wait a minute":**

Instead of falling unconscious, you remain standing with 0 HP and immediately gain a Phantom Turn™, an extra bonus action that ignores initiative and slips between you and death like an undocumented feature in production.

- During this **Phantom Turn™**, you can take:
- 1 action,
- 1 move,
- 1 bonus action.

**You cannot** heal yourself or gain HP in any way (not even through magic, potions, or comfort food).

- At the end of the Ghost Turn™, if you have not been healed by any outside source, you fall unconscious as expected and begin rolling your death saves with a slight sense of regret.

- **Does not work** if you are reduced to 0 HP by effects that disintegrate, vaporize, or turn you into magic jelly. Ignoring is fine, but dust does not read messages.

### Side Effects:

- Each time you activate this ability, you receive a **recurring dream** in which the Lord of Death calls you on the phone. You ignore the call. He leaves a message. Growing more annoyed.

- At the DM's discretion, you may say the phrase:
**"Not now, Death. I have better things to ignore."**
to gain **bardic inspiration**. Even if you are not a bard. Or inspired.

##### I haven't read the terms of the soul contract. So technically I can't die.
