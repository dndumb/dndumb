This beautiful blade is hollow in the middle and can store the blood it spills. It is said that it was once used to turn immortals into mortals by injecting them with a mortal being's blood.

**Benefits:**

- You gain a \+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**To turn an immortal into a mortal, you must:**

1. The person must be unconscious (0 HP).
2. The person must be placed inside a ritual pentagram, which must have 5 gems worth 1,000 gold coins each positioned at its points.
3. The person must be injected with half their HPs worth of blood from one non-immortal person; the blood must be fresh.
4. By then starting a prayer to the god of death, it is possible to make an immortal person mortal.

**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**_Light._** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
