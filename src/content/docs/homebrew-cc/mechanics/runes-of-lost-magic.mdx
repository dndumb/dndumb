“Runes are not mere symbols. They are scars of primordial magic, traced upon reality itself.”
</DescriptiveBox>

## General Concept
**Runes** are remnants of a forgotten arcane art, capable of channeling magic in crystallized form.
Each rune contains a **single-use spell**, but not all runes are the same.

**Ancient runes**, dating back to primordial times and often found in dungeons, are perfectly stable: their energy does not run out and they can remain active for centuries.
In contrast, modern runes, created by contemporary wizards seeking to imitate their power, are imperfect copies. These artificial runes **lose their power 3 days** after their creation, dissolving into pure arcane energy.

Anyone can activate them, but only wizards fully understand how to copy them and **temporarily preserve their power**.
## Rules of Runes

### Finding and Identifying a Rune
- Each rune contains **a specific spell** (level 1–6, at the DM's discretion).  
- To identify the rune:
**Intelligence (Arcane) check** → DC = 10 + spell level.
If successful, the character recognizes the symbol and the magical effect it contains.

### Using a Rune
- **Anyone can use a rune**, even if they are not a spellcaster.  
- Activating it requires **one action** and an **Arcana check DC 6 + rune level**.  
  - **Success:** the spell activates as if cast at **base level**.  
  - **Failure:** the rune shatters and is lost without effect.  
- Runes do not require material, verbal, or somatic components.
- After activation, the rune **is consumed and disappears**.

### Copying a Rune (Mages Only)
A mage can **copy and freeze** the power of a rune to preserve it for a few days.

#### Requirements:
- Must have access to an active rune.  
- Spends **1 hour per rune level** studying and engraving.  
- Spends **a spell slot equal to the rune level**.  
- Rolls **Intelligence (Arcana)** DC 10 + rune level.

#### Outcome:
- **Success:** creates a *Frozen Rune*, identical to the original.  
- **Failure:** the rune shatters and the magic dissipates.  
- Copied runes **last 3 days**, then expire and become inert.

<DescriptiveBox>
The wizard can copy runes containing spells he does not know: the rune acts as an external magic matrix, not as a spell in the spellbook.

### Time Limitations
Runes **can only be created during game sessions** and not between sessions.  
It is assumed that wizards are engaged in other studies or duties between adventures and do not have time to keep the unstable energies of the runes active.

## Rune Levels and Rarity

| Level | Spell Example | Arcane CD (use) | Duration | Rarity |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | *Magic Missile*, *Shield* | 13 | 3 days | Common |
| 2 | *Mirror Image*, *Scorching Ray* | 14 | 3 days | Uncommon |
| 3 | *Counterspell*, *Fireball* | 15 | 3 days | Rare |
| 4 | *Dimension Door* | 16 | 3 days | Very Rare |
| 5 | *Wall of Force* | 17 | 3 days | Ultra Rare |
| 6 | *Disintegrate*, *Globe of Invulnerability* | 18 | 3 days | Legendary |

## Unstable Runes (Optional Variant)
Some runes, especially those hastily copied or found in contaminated places, may be **unstable**.

When an unstable rune expires (after 3 days) or is activated with a failure, roll 1d6:

| d6 | Effect |
|----|----------|
| 1 | **Arcane Explosion:** The rune releases raw energy. Every creature within 3 meters takes 1d6 force damage per level of the rune (DC 13 saving throw halves damage). |
| 2 | **Magical Resonance:** A random spell of equal level is activated on a random target within 9 meters. |
| 3 | **Residual Discharge:** The user is *blinded* until the end of their next turn. |
| 4–5 | **Dissipation:** The rune deactivates without effect. |
| 6 | **Arcane Backflow:** The user gains advantage on their next Arcana check within 1 hour. |

Unstable runes can be intentionally created by daring wizards seeking greater power... at their own risk.

## Examples of Unique Runes

| Rune Name | Effect | Type |
|------------|----------|------|
| **Bloodbond Rune** | Creates a magical bond with an ally: both gain +1 AC for 1 minute. | Minor rune |
| **Deep Silence Rune** | Creates an area of *Silence* centered on the user (6 m radius, 1 minute). | Medium rune |
| **Rune of Arcane Echo** | After casting a spell, you can reroll 1d4 and add it to the spell's attack roll or saving throw DC. | Greater rune |
| **Rune of Primordial Chaos** | Activates a random magical effect (Wild Magic table). | Unstable rune |

### Narrative Use
Runes provide an excellent starting point for:
- “Intelligent” treasures in dungeons.
- Traces of ancient civilizations.
- Temporary rewards to balance groups without spellcasters.
- A “timed” magic system that encourages players to explore, create, and take risks.
