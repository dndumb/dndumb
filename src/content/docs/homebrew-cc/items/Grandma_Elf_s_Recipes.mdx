Halfway between a recipe book and a grimoire of domestic alchemy, this manuscript was written in elegant calligraphy, stained with flour and occasionally with ink... or sauce from something you'd rather not know about.

<NoteBox>
According to the marginal notes, **the author is the same half-blind elf** who invented the *Homeopathic Healing Potion*, and she calls herself “**Grandmother Fialle of Boscoquieto, Archmage of the Stove**.”

## **1. Inconsistent Memory Soup**

**Type:** Magical hot dish  
**Effect:** After tasting it, the character remembers with extreme clarity *something that never happened.*  
Lasts 1d4 hours. Does not grant advantages, but can create narrative confusion.

<DescriptiveBox>
##### Grandmother Fialle  
“If you don't have good memories, cook them yourself.” 
</DescriptiveBox>

**Ingredients:**
- Whispering mushroom broth  
- 1 tablespoon of blended dreams (ask a bard)  
- Onion tear collected *without crying*  
- Salt, but only the kind that reminds you of your mother

**CD Cooking (Survival):** 13  
If successful, the soup gives off a nostalgic aroma; if unsuccessful, it stinks of regret.

## **2. Telepathic Conversation Cookies**

**Effect:** For 10 minutes after eating one, you can communicate **telepathically (9-meter range)** with anyone eating the same cookie.  
However, all thoughts are transmitted *in a passive-aggressive tone*, even if you don't want them to be.

<NoteBox>
Perfect for family gatherings, terrible for guild meetings.  
</NoteBox>

**Ingredients:**
- Elven barley flour
- Chocolate chips made by a druid (consent required)
- Sugar refined from childhood dreams
- Distilled gossip essence  

**CD Cooking (Crafting):** 15  
If you mess up, the cookies will just make you really want to criticize other people's fashion choices.

## **3. Spiritual Growth Bread (literal)**

**Effect:** Those who eat a slice grow **10 cm for 1 hour**, then return to their normal size, leaving their clothes perfectly ironed.  
It does not affect statistics, but it impresses those who do not know the trick.

**Ingredients:**
- Morning yeast (must be awakened with a cheerful song)  
- Cloud flour (collected with a barrel or an ambitious idea)  
- A pinch of self-esteem  
- Time... lots of time  

<DescriptiveBox>
##### Grandma Fialle  
“The secret to successful bread? Make it believe it can become something great.”  
</DescriptiveBox>

**CD Cooking:** 12  
If unsuccessful, the bread rises until it explodes, covering the cook with sticky morals.

## **4. Awkward Silence Tea**

**Effect:** Those who drink it cannot speak for 10 minutes, but communicate perfectly through *expressive sighs and eloquent glances.*  
During this time, they gain advantage on *Stealth* rolls, but disadvantage on *Persuasion* rolls.

**Ingredients:**
- New moon tea leaves  
- Water that “doesn't feel like boiling”  
- Petals of socially anxious chamomile  
- A non-judgmental sugar cube

<NoteBox>
Not to be confused with the Tea of Absolute Silence: that one literally makes you disappear.  
</NoteBox>

**CD Cooking:** 10  
If it fails, the drink just causes a long, awkward pause.

## **5. Tart of Unexplainable Serenity**

**Effect:** Those who eat it feel a deep and unmotivated peace. For 1 hour, they gain advantage against the effects of *fear and stress*, but disadvantage on *Initiative* rolls (“everything will be fine, even if it's not”).  

**Ingredients:**
- Smile fruits (anything that makes you smile is fine)  
- Clarified moon butter
- A pinch of “let it be, it doesn't matter”
- A crust of infinite (or almost infinite) patience

<DescriptiveBox>
##### Grandma Fialle  
“Serenity is a cake that should be served warm. Never hot, never cold.”  
</DescriptiveBox>

**CD Cooking:** 14  
If unsuccessful, the tart causes only a long and vague aesthetic melancholy.

### **DM Notes**

- All of Grandma Fialle's dishes contain **a slight aura of enchantment and confusion**, recognizable with *Detect Magic*.  
- Eating more than two in the same day requires a **Wisdom saving throw DC 12** to avoid a mild episode of *“domestic magic syndrome”* (the character starts giving culinary advice to monsters).  
- You can find an entire tome of similar recipes entitled *“Cooking Without Understanding Why”*, sold for 50 mo in alchemists' shops... or at bard markets.
