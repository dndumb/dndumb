*Magical market, common (beware its employees may knock on your door)*

The Folletto Stand is a curious market attraction in any large city or village where magic intertwines with everyday life. Run by an enigmatic vendorâ€”usually a well-groomed half-elf with a quick tongue and a disarming smileâ€”the stall offers not objects, but actual magical sprites that can help with any household or manual task.

##### The vendorâ€™s motto is
*Why bother when magic can do it all for you?*
</DescriptiveBox>

The stallâ€™s appearance is as captivating as it is chaotic. Made of carved wood and decorated with floral motifs, it is adorned with tiny fairy lights that float lazily. The counter is covered with small bottles of fairy dust, miniature contracts, and magical gadgets. Above it all is an animated sign that lights up intermittently, depicting a row of sprites busy sweeping, hammering, and washing dishes.

### The Sprites of the Sprite
The sprites sold at the stall are tiny creatures about a foot tall, with transparent dragonfly-like wings and large, glittering eyes. Each pixie is dressed in a customizable uniform that varies based on the type of work they have been "programmed" to do.

#### House Pixie
Specializes in cleaning, washing, and tidying up.
They can clean an entire room in a few minutes using magic dust to remove stains or stubborn dirt.
They have a small brush for a tail and an apron.

#### Repair Pixie
They excel at repairing objects, such as furniture, weapons, or broken tools.
They have a tiny magic hammer and wings that emit sparks as they work.

#### Gardener Pixie
They take care of plants and gardens, pruning, watering, and even talking to plants to encourage their growth.
They carry a small watering can and green gloves.

#### Handyman Pixie
A combination of the above, but less specialized. Perfect for those who need a hand with everything.
They have a more robust appearance and a magical backpack from which they extract various tools.

### Imp Characteristics
- **Longevity** Imps are magically bound to the person who purchases them. They live for about a year before their magic wears off, returning them to their fairy dimension.
- **Energy** Each imp can work up to 8 hours a day before having to "rest" in a small magical gem provided with the purchase.
- **Food** They feed on magic dust, which can also be purchased at the stall.

### Personality
Impels are not only helpful; they are also incredibly talkative and love interacting with their masters. However, they can be a little touchy if treated badly or ignored, refusing to work until they are offered some form of apology or "gift".

### Game Rules
A character who purchases a imp must choose the type of work the imp is specialized in. Imps offer significant advantages in non-combat situations, as follows

#### House Imp
Makes an environment spotlessly clean in 10 minutes.
Reduces the chance of disease from dirty environments by 50%.

#### Repair Imp
Repairs any nonmagical item (up to moderate damage) in 1 hour.
Can repair a magic item with a DC 15 Arcana test.

#### Garden Imp
Increases the yield of a crop by 25% in a week.
Heals a wilted or dying plant in 1 day.

#### Imp Handyman
Can perform an unskilled job with an automatic success on Skill rolls up to DC 10.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Package
A player can purchase the cleaning and maintenance package with which the Imp will take care of all the household chores and repairs at costs included in the price by refurbishing the designated building, this has a cost per intervention and in the case of very dirty or ruined buildings or places it will be necessary to carry out several interventions to restore their conditions.

### Cost
- **Purchase of an Imp** 250 gold coins.
- **Magic Dust (for 1 month of work)** 50 gold coins.
- **Magic Gem Maintenance** Every 3 months, the gem must be recharged for 25 gold coins.
- **Cleaning and Maintenance Package** 10 gold coins per intervention

##### What the Imps Say
The Imps of Folletto are incredibly happy to work for you! They swear by it, with smiles as wide as the sky, and who are we to doubt it? Sure, the magic that binds them to their tasks prevents them from complaining or rebelling... but that's just an irrelevant detail! After all, who wouldn't be thrilled to spend eternity scrubbing floors, repairing chairs, or watering geraniums?

**administrative note** *any mention of "magical slavery" is pure fantasy and does not reflect the reality of Folletto by Worker Inc.'s operations. Please ignore any pleading looks or tears shining in their big eyes. ðŸ˜‡*
