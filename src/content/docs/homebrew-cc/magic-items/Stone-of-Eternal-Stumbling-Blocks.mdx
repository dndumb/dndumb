## Description
At first glance, this small grayish stone looks like a simple river rock, smoothed by time and devoid of any particular features.  
However, upon closer inspection, one can see tiny circular engravings on its surface, resembling small concentric waves.  
Who created it? No one knows, but those who stumbled upon it had plenty of time to think about it as they fell.

<DescriptiveBox>
"A small stone for man, a big tumble for those who don't watch where they step."
</DescriptiveBox>

## Effect
When the **Stone of Eternal Stumbles** is placed on the ground or on a stable surface (such as a floor or rock), it creates an **invisible magic field** with a radius of **3 meters (10 feet)**.  

Any creature that **ends its turn within this area** must make a **Dexterity saving throw DC 18**, or it stumbles badly and **falls prone**.  
Those who fail the save not only fall, but their dignity also suffers psychological damage (not mechanical, but very visible).

**DM Note:**

 If someone stumbles twice in a row... it's only fair that they stay there and think about their choices.

## Limitations
- The stone **has no effect if held in your hand**, carried in a backpack, or placed on an unstable surface (such as a boat, a moving cart, or a flying carpet).  
- It also does not work if you throw it at someone—in that case, it is just a rock.  

## Duration and Range
The effect remains active **as long as the stone is in contact with a stable surface** and has not been moved.  
If it is removed or lifted, the field disappears immediately, along with any hope of tripping up the approaching ogre.

## Creative Use
Many adventurers use it to create **improvised traps** or to **defend a narrow passage**.  
Others, more creative (or more sadistic), use it to sabotage their friends during acrobatic trials.  

Some legendary thieves keep it as an **ace up their sleeve**, to trip up their pursuers at the most critical moment.  

<NoteBox>
Once, one of them used it to knock down a dragon. It didn't do much good, but at least the story made the bards laugh for weeks.

## Magical Detection
A **Detection of Magic** spell reveals a **weak aura of invocation and illusion** around the stone.  

<NoteBox>
Scholars debate whether the stone generates a magical field or simply a "universal curse of distraction."

## Trivia
- No one knows how many Stones of Eternal Stumbling exist. Perhaps there are infinite numbers, or perhaps there is only one that teleports itself whenever someone curses.  
- Some claim that the stone only activates when it hears giggling nearby.  
- Legend has it that a fake copy of the stone is on display in a museum... but even there, everyone ends up falling in front of the display case.
