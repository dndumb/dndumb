### Description
This simple bronze ring, decorated with tiny carvings of cats that appear to walk in circles, exudes an aura of tranquility. It is warm to the touch and tightens slightly on the finger when worn.

### Properties
**Environmental Stealth:** While wearing the ring, you make ambient sounds that match your surroundings. For example, the clanking of your armor might change to a gentle breeze if you're in a forest or the dripping of water if you're in a cave. This gives you advantage on Stealth checks.

**Interfering Awareness:** If the wearer is made aware of the ring's properties (such as by an ally or by magic), the ring immediately loses its magic until it is passed to another unaware wearer.

##### Fun Facts:
This ring was created by a prankster wizard to help clumsy apprentices move silently without knowing it.

Some wearers report hearing a faint *"meow"* every now and then, but no one knows why.
