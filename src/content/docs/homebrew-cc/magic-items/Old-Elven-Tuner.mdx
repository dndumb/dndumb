## Description
A small device made of **brass and olive wood**, carved in the shape of an elven oak leaf.  

When screwed onto the neck of a stringed instrument, the tuner emits a **soft harmonic hum**, like a sigh accompanying the music.  
It appears inert to the eye, but those who use it with sincere intent perceive an echo of ancient, sweet, and melancholic melodies.

## Magical Properties

The tuner tunes into the instrument on which it is mounted.
When a bard **fails an attack**, a test, or an action using **a stringed instrument as a catalyst for their abilities or spells**, they can use their reaction to activate the Old Elven Tuner.

Upon activation:
- The instrument's strings vibrate autonomously, producing a pure, resonant sound wave.
- This vibration restores magical harmony, allowing the bard to immediately regain their action.
- The bard can then repeat the same action or choose a different one (attack, spell, movement, item use, etc.) during the same turn.
- The tuner does not cancel the result of the failure, but grants the bard an immediate second chance—as if the rhythm of combat bent to allow another beat.

The tuner can be used up to 3 times per day and recharges at dawn.

<NoteBox>
**Example:**

During combat, the bard casts Vicious Mockery, but the enemy passes the saving throw.
The bard can then use his reaction to activate the Old Elven Tuner.
He gets his action back and can:
- cast Vicious Mockery again,
- or perform a different action, such as Attack, Dodge, or another spell.
</NoteBox>


## Limitations
- It can be activated **only once per round**.  
- The tuner works **only on stringed instruments** (lute, violin, harp, etc.).  
- If the tuner is removed, it temporarily loses its magic until the next dawn.

## Rule Clarifications
- The tuner **uses the bard's reaction**, so it cannot be combined with other reactions in the same round (e.g., Counterspell or Uncanny Dodge).
- If the repeated action has a **spell slot cost**, it is **consumed normally**.
- The tuner **does not allow you to repeat a saving throw**: it only provides an additional action.
- It cannot be used **outside of your turn**, unless the failure occurs during the bard's turn.

## DM Notes
This item provides an excellent *second chance* mechanic for bards without being unbalanced.  
You can consider it a gift from significant NPCs (such as the grandmother in your story), an elven heirloom, or a musical legacy.  
It adds narrative depth and gives the character a poetic and personal touch.

## Additional Flavor (optional)
When used, the strings of the instrument emit a **soft golden glow**, and for a moment, the air is filled with the **scent of ancient wood and honey**.  
Anyone who hears that sound for a moment feels **nostalgia for a happy memory** they don't know they have.
