## Description
<CensoredText>
A polished steel scabbard, adorned with dwarven runes of patience,
discipline, and—ironically—*precision*.
Inside, it conceals a blade as thin as an elf's lie. No one knows
exactly how to draw it, except those who can decipher the ingenious (and
absurd) mechanism left incomplete by its creators.

## Unlocking the Blade
<CensoredText>
When characters find this weapon, it is locked in its sheath.
To understand how to draw it, a character must pass an **Intelligence check (DC 20)**.
They can attempt this once per **long or short rest**.
On success, they discover the correct method (which, according to legend,
If successful, they discover the correct method (which, according to legend,
consists of uttering three dwarven curses in perfect alphabetical order
while turning the hilt counterclockwise).

Once unlocked, the blade responds only to its attuned user.

## Dance of Perfect Flow (1/day)
<CensoredText>
With a bonus action, the wearer can activate the blade's power.
For a fleeting moment, the whole world slows down, and the warrior's movements
become pure perfection.

During this turn, the user can perform **an infinite series
of attacks** with this weapon, until **they miss a strike**.
Each successful strike seems to merge into the next, creating a flawless flow of
movements.

As soon as an attack fails, the effect ends immediately.

At the end of the turn, the perfection vanishes.
The user falls prone and is overcome by a wave of divine fatigue, suffering
**disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks until
the end of their next short rest**.

##### Master Naldur's comment:
"It works! ...But then it takes two days and a barrel of beer to
recover."

## Origin
<CensoredText>
Forged by the **Martelfine Clan**, famous for their perfect weapons and
their equally perfect disasters.
The Blade of Deadly Ecstasy was to be given to a champion of Moradin
during the **Holy War of the Golden Ashes**, but the unlocking mechanism
was never completed: the apprentice in charge of the system died
crushed by an “inspired” anvil.
Since then, the blade has remained locked for centuries, an object of worship and
frustration for anyone who has tried to extract it.

## Trivia
-   It is said that the sheath emits a sarcastic **“click”** every time
    someone tries to open it the wrong way.
-   If a dwarf tries to force it open with brute force, the blade remains
    closed but the sheath begins to vibrate as if laughing.
-   Some scholars believe that the blade is not unfinished... but
    simply **too perfect to be wielded by imperfect hands.**
