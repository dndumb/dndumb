Except when it comes to opening it."

## Description

A polished steel scabbard, finely decorated with dwarven runes of
patience, discipline, and—ironically—*precision*.
It shows no obvious openings or mechanisms. The blade inside appears to be
real, but no one has yet managed to draw it.

It feels cold to the touch, but transmits a slight vibration, as if it were alive
or... annoyed.

## Properties (While sealed)

-   **Type:** Unknown (presumably rapier)
-   **Damage:** ---
-   **Properties:** ---
-   **Bonus:** ---
-   **Tuning Requirement:** None (impossible to tune
    while sealed)

## Mystery of the Blade
Those who attempt to open it notice an intricate system of runes, microscopic joints,
and symbols of dwarven craftsmanship.
A character can attempt to understand its function with an **Intelligence check
(DC 20)** once per **long or short rest**.

At present, no one has ever found the correct way to extract the
blade.

##### Proverb of the Martelfine Clan
*"If you can't open it, try a hammer. If it breaks, it wasn't
meant to be."*

## Presumed Origin
Scholars believe the weapon is the work of the **Martelfine Clan**, a
family of dwarf blacksmiths famous as much for their ingenious inventions
as for their... tragic ends.
Some chronicles speak of an unfinished “holy blade” intended for
a champion during the **Holy War of the Golden Ashes**, but the
connection has never been confirmed.

##### Epitaph on the tomb of apprentice Gorlun Martelfine
“No blade is purer than one that no one can wield.”

## Trivia
-   It is said that the sheath emits a sarcastic **“click”** every time
    someone tries to open it the wrong way.
-   If a dwarf tries to force it open with brute force, the blade remains
    closed but the sheath begins to vibrate as if laughing.
-   Some scholars believe that the blade is not unfinished... but
    simply **too perfect to be wielded by imperfect hands.**
    imperfect.**
