An interplanar being that is:

- Half Mimic
- Half Artisan's Tools
- Half food supplies _(no, Jim, that's not "too many halves", it's interplanar, it can have as many halves as it needs to, thank you, I don't make the rules)_
- ¾ Bag of Holding

## Origin

A creature born from the experiments of ancient warlock grannies—most likely suffering from senile dementia—plagued by the conflicting needs of:

- Compulsive embroidery
- Self-defense from potential _rapers_ _(you know who you are, incognito mode does not protect you from **Detect Youporn Category**)_
- The urge to feed their nephews because _"Sei sciupato"_ no matter how obese they are.

## Appearance

Appears as an innocuous **blue tin box** with reassuring depictions of buttery cookies and bucolic landscapes. This anomaly hides secrets that would be best left uncovered.

## Behavior

- **When closed:** Sits quietly, most likely in the most secluded recesses of a kitchen cupboard.
- **When opened:** Risks arise. The opener is usually:
  - A barbarian starving after eating _"only"_ two whole roasted boars.
  - A charisma-based magic user who can't keep their nose and hands where they belong _(as well as other bodily appendages, but that is not of concern here—damn, now I have that image stuck in my head)_.

## Content (Roll a D6)

| D6  | Content           |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Butter Cookies    |
| 2   | Bag of Holding    |
| 3   | A Monstrosity     |
| 4-6 | Weaver's Supplies |

### Content Descriptions

**Butter Cookies**

- Count as **Rations (1 day)**, but only if eaten straight from the box.
- If stored in any other container, they transform into **moldy crumbs** unsuitable for consumption.

**Bag of Holding**

- The tin box behaves like a **Bag of Holding**, except for its rigid blue metallic exterior.
- Cannot be turned inside out.
- Allows users to store and retrieve items.

**Monstrosity**

- Uses the **stat block of the Mimic**, except its body cannot leave the tin box entirely.
- The exterior of the tin box and the lid are **not part of the creature** and lack the **Adhesive** property.

**Weaver's Supplies**

- Exactly that, nothing special here.

## Reset Rules

When the lid is closed again:

- The content is **partially reset**:
  - The D6 must be rolled again when reopened.
  - **Butter Cookies** or **Weaver's Supplies** may or may not be refilled (DM's discretion).
  - If the **Monstrosity** wasn't killed, it is healed to full HP and loses any acquired states.
  - The **Bag of Holding** retains all previously stored items.
