title: Living Lighter
---

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

---

The **Living Lighter** is an essential item for every smoker.

Whether you favor relaxing with a pipe or inhaling the aroma of a cigar, this is the perfect accessory for you!

It's a small cilinder with a microscopic portal on one of its ends that leads directly into the Elemental Plane of Fire, with a diminutive fairy chained to the front.

### Usage

As an action, you can ask the fairy to fart onto the micro-portal, so that their gaseous emissions will be lit to fire. 

The size and intensity of this fire is very limited, so it can be used to set fire to something (like your cigar or tobacco, or if you are a boring person, your campfire), but can't be thrown or used for attacks.

### Properties

The Lighter has 6 charges, and restores one of them every time your fairy eats something. (Whenever you eat food, you can share a little morsel with your fairy, that will keep them satiated for one day).

Each time you use the Lighter, roll a **d6**.
- If you roll a number that is greater or equal than the number of remaining charges, the fairy has a small accident and shits into the portal instead of just farting. You will have to clean your Lighter before being able to use it again.
