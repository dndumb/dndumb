*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a Warlock)*

The **Pelvic Blast** is the inevitable result of too much eldritch energy channeled into… unconventional places.  
Crafted as a joke by a bored archfey (or possibly the god of bad pickup lines), the ring of Pelvic Blast grants its wearer the unique (and slightly embarrassing) ability to unleash an *Eldritch Blast* from below the belt.  

It’s not subtle. It’s not classy. But it *is* unforgettable.

##### The inscription inside the band reads:
*"With great pelvis, comes great responsibility."*  
Additional scribbles note: *“For indoor use only.”*

### Mechanics
- While wearing the ring, you may cast **Eldritch Blast** as if it originated from your pelvis.  
- Somatic and verbal components remain unchanged, but you *must* adopt a thrusting motion when casting. Failure to do so imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.  
  *(Your DM is encouraged—nay, obliged—to demand a demonstration at the table.)*
- Only Warlocks can attune to this ring. Others who attempt to wear it suffer from chronic pelvic cramps until they remove it.  

<NoteBox>
**Warning:** Casting Pelvic Blast in polite society may result in exile, laughter, or unexpected proposals.  
Repeat offenders are often asked to “leave the kingdom and never pelvis again.”

### Scaling Effects (because size *does* matter)
| Warlock Level | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| 1–4           | Standard **Eldritch Blast** (1 beam) with radiant pelvic glow. |
| 5–10          | **Extra Beam:** Each additional beam is accompanied by a *suggestive pelvic thrust.* Targets may suffer psychic damage from secondhand embarrassment. |
| 11–16         | **Fertile Arcana:** On a critical hit, target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or risk a magical pregnancy (gender and species… negotiable). Midwives *hate* this one trick. |
| 17+           | **Legendary Pelvis:** Once per long rest, you may unleash the **Barrage of Passion**, firing beams in a 30ft cone. All creatures hit take normal damage and must succeed a Wisdom save or become *awkwardly charmed* for 1 minute. Victims often describe the experience as “intensely confusing.” |

### Random Side Effects (d100)
Whenever you cast Pelvic Blast, roll a d100. On a 25% chance, something *weird* happens:

| d100 | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 01–10 | Your pants catch fire. No damage, just dramatic. |
| 11–20 | A nearby lute begins to strum sensually on its own. |
| 21–30 | A random NPC mistakes the blast for a marriage proposal. |
| 31–40 | Your pelvis emits a fog cloud (smells faintly of roses). |
| 41–50 | A celestial voice whispers: *“Nice thrust.”* |
| 51–60 | Roll a Charisma save: on fail, you moan involuntarily. Loudly. |
| 61–70 | A spectral disco ball descends above you for 1 minute. |
| 71–80 | Target hears *Careless Whisper* in their head until next turn. |
| 81–90 | You gain temporary advantage on Persuasion checks vs. tavern-goers. |
| 91–100 | Everyone in a 20 ft radius must make a Wisdom save or start slow-dancing uncontrollably. |

### Roleplay Hooks
- Ancient bards whisper of the *Pelvic Sage*, a Warlock who once ended a battle by “overthrusting” the enemy army into surrender.  
- Certain taverns run illegal **Pelvic Duels** after midnight. Bets are high, shame is higher.  
- Some fertility cults use the ring in sacred rituals. Participation is… optional, but observers must sign a waiver.  
- A bardic drinking song begins: *“By pelvis be purged, by pelvis be blessed…”* and is usually banned after the second chorus.

### NPC Reactions Table
Whenever an NPC witnesses a Pelvic Blast for the first time, roll a d6:

| d6 | Reaction |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Shocked silence, followed by hysterical laughter. |
| 2  | *“By the gods… marry me.”* |
| 3  | Attempts to mimic the motion, strains a hip. |
| 4  | Convinced you are the chosen one of a forgotten fertility deity. |
| 5  | Writes a ballad on the spot: *“The Warlock and His Mighty Beam.”* |
| 6  | Reports you to the local guards for “public obscenity via magic.” |

### Critical Failures (Pelvic Misfires)
If you roll a natural 1 when casting:

- Your thrust backfires, knocking you prone.  
- You sprain your hip (movement speed halved until healed).  
- The beam fizzles out as glitter, covering everyone in a 10 ft radius.  
- Your pants vanish into another dimension. Forever.
