### Spell Description

You choose one creature that you can see within range and transform it into a non-magical pile of **excrement**. The transformation lasts for the duration.

- If you **maintain concentration** for the full hour, the transformation becomes **permanent** until dispelled.
- This spell has no effect on **shapechangers** or creatures with **0 hit points**.
- An **unwilling creature** can make a **Wisdom saving throw** to resist the transformation. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected.

The target transforms, along with all it is wearing and carrying, into a pile of feces. While in this form:
- The creatureâ€™s **statistics** are replaced by that of the pile of excrement.
- The creature retains no **memory** of the time spent in this form once the spell ends, and it returns to its original form.
