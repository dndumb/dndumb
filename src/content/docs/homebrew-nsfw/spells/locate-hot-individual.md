title: Locate Hot Individual
---

*4th-level divination*

---

- **Components:** V, S, M (an item previously possessed by the individual, such as a scarf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

### Spell Description

You sniff an item that was in possession of a hot individual. You sense the direction to their location, provided the creature is within **1,000 feet** of you. If the creature is moving, you also know the direction of their movement.

The spell works as long as the individual meets your personal standards of "hot." If the individual you described or named is in a different form—such as being under the effects of a **polymorph** spell—this spell does not locate them.

**Limitations:**
- This spell cannot locate an individual if running water at least **10 feet wide** blocks the direct path between you and them.
- The spell also fails if the individual has recently experienced significant blood loss from their private parts (within the last **24 hours**).
