Welcome, dear traveler, to **The Wonders of Wyrmwood**, a compendium like no other. Within these pages lies a collection of artifacts, enchantments, weapons, and oddities plucked from every corner of the cosmos—and a few corners that defy the concept of corners altogether. Gathered by the enigmatic merchant Wyrmwood, this tome promises to captivate your curiosity, spark your imagination, and perhaps leave you questioning the very fabric of reality.

## Who is Wyrmwood?

Who, you may ask, is Wyrmwood? Ah, therein lies the first of many mysteries. Some claim he is a dragon polymorphed into mortal form, endlessly wandering in search of treasure not to hoard but to share. Others whisper that Wyrmwood is a being from a realm beyond the known planes, a traveler with no home and no destination. He’s been described as everything from a charismatic swindler to a sage of immeasurable wisdom. Wyrmwood himself, if you’re lucky enough to meet him, would likely chuckle and offer a different answer each time—always accompanied by a mischievous glint in his eye.

## The Collection

Wyrmwood’s collection is no ordinary bazaar. He has bartered with celestial archons in the heavens, outwitted demons in the Abyss, and convinced eldritch beings from the Far Realm to part with their peculiar trinkets. Whether these items are relics of immeasurable power, tools of subtle mischief, or simply curiosities that defy explanation, Wyrmwood assures each is *absolutely one-of-a-kind, unless you count the duplicates.* A joke, perhaps? Or perhaps not.

## The Purpose of This Tome

For all his wit and whimsy, Wyrmwood’s ultimate purpose remains an enigma. Is he a collector, a storyteller, or merely a wanderer with a penchant for the peculiar? Some say he’s on a quest of his own, piecing together fragments of a grander puzzle. Others believe he is simply here to remind us that even in the darkest of dungeons, there is wonder to be found—if only you know where to look.

## A Word of Advice

As you delve into this manual, let it be both a guide and a companion. May you find inspiration, humor, and perhaps a hint of Wyrmwood’s boundless curiosity within these pages. Remember, every item has a story, every story has a lesson, and every lesson has a price—but in Wyrmwood’s words, “A fair price! Unless, of course, you’re buying on credit.”

## Closing Remarks

Go forth, and may your journey be as wondrous as the tales within.
